Report-7

1. Read sections 2-2.5
Read. I learnt the defintitions and usage of variable names; data types and sizes; constants; 
declaration; and arithematic operators better than what I had knew in the first section. 
Also, I learnt about regulations of using the correct forms for them. 
For instance, we tend to use short names for local variables, especially loop indices, 
and longer names for external variables. 

2. Do exercises from this sections.
Done. At this point ,  I had the chance to chance to use standard header <limit.h> for Ex.2.1. 
I also learnt about ranges of char, short, int, and long variables, both signed and unsigned.
