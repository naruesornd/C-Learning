report-12

1. Read sections 3-3.4
Read. I have learnt about control-flow statements which specify the order in which computations are performed. I have learnt terms like semicolon in C is rather a statement terminator than a separator as it is in languages like Pascal.
These sections mainly focus on how statements and blocks, If-Else, Else-if and switch work.

2. Do exercises from these sections.
Done.
