report-13

1. Read sections 3.5-3.8
Read. I have learned further about control flow in which I get to understand more about structures and uses of loops like while, for, do-while. Additionally, I learned about functions like shellsort which sorts ana array of integers and itoa which converts integer into characters in a  string and simplification of other functions that I had learnt before such as reverse and atoi, trim. Lastly,I got to understand how loop aids like break and continue work, not to mention goto statement.

2. Do exercises from these sections.
Done. ex 3.4-3.6
